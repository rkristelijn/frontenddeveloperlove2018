First, we'll make our application installable to homescreen by adding a Web App Manifest json file. Next, we'll focus on making our app reliable by enabling service workers inside our application and caching resources. Throughout this session we'll also learn how to use Lighthouse to test the performance of our PWA.",

This session shows how to leverage this less known technology dozing under the CLI's covers. For this, you will learn how Schematics work and how we can write npm packages that provide additional code generators. You will also see how to modify existing source files, e. g. in order to register a generated component with an existing module. For this, we will use the TypeScript's compilers services which allow to directly manipulate the application's abstract syntax tree. After this session you know the build-in options for automating repetitive and boring programming tasks.",

Add no animations and your users will feel sometimes lost. Add too much and they will be disgusted. But, to make it harder, animations by themselves have to be configured just right to have a meaning. Speed, duration and the object being animated have to be set just right. Now, Vue already provides us with two nice components: transition and transition-group that are based on CSS animations. But what about the state? Numerical values that change and you want to animate. During my talk, I will explain what state transitions are, how they differ from CSS transitions, what are they used for and show some practical implementations.

In this talk, you’ll learn about my experience building Elocute, a web app for language teachers with a paired mobile app that students use to perfect their spoken language skills. You’ll discover how to build for the web and mobile platforms using NativeScript and Vue, making the most of the best of both platforms - data entry on the web, and speech-to-text on mobile. Let’s learn about how Vue can be used to build for the web and for mobile apps, sharing the love.",

In this session, we’ll cover some key use cases for these functions within a Vue.js application: we’ll accept payments with stripe, we’ll gather geolocation data from Google Maps, and more! We’ll make it all work with Vue and Nuxt seamlessly, simplifying how to leverage this paradigm to be a workhorse for your application.",
