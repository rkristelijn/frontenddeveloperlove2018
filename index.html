First, we'll make our application installable to homescreen by adding a Web App Manifest json file. Next, we'll focus on making our app reliable by enabling service workers inside our application and caching resources. Throughout this session we'll also learn how to use Lighthouse to test the performance of our PWA.",

In this talk I'd like to highlight the key concepts of Reactive Programming inside MobX like observables and observers, computed values and actions. Also I'm going to share a real example that will cover the key parts of a frontend application like: . consuming a remote endpoint . managing the data flow . structuring the relation between views and store. reacting to changes.",

This session shows how to leverage this less known technology dozing under the CLI's covers. For this, you will learn how Schematics work and how we can write npm packages that provide additional code generators. You will also see how to modify existing source files, e. g. in order to register a generated component with an existing module. For this, we will use the TypeScript's compilers services which allow to directly manipulate the application's abstract syntax tree.

While this is not true, some believed it wasn’t and as a consequence, discarded it as a possible choice for their next application even though they were enjoying very much developing applications with Vue. During this talk I will elaborate on what makes Vue simple to approach by exploring its mindset and its associated features.

Add no animations and your users will feel sometimes lost. Add too much and they will be disgusted. But, to make it harder, animations by themselves have to be configured just right to have a meaning. Speed, duration and the object being animated have to be set just right. Now, Vue already provides us with two nice components: transition and transition-group that are based on CSS animations. But what about the state? Numerical values that change and you want to animate. During my talk, I will explain what state transitions are, how they differ from CSS transitions, what are they used for and show some practical implementations. We will cover good and bad practices while we delight ourselves with some demos.",

Despite the name, Serverless does not mean you’re not using a server, rather, the promise of Serverless is to no longer have to babysit a server. Scaling is done for you, you’re billed only for what you use. In this session, we’ll cover some key use cases for these functions within a Vue.js application: we’ll accept payments with stripe, we’ll gather geolocation data from Google Maps, and more! We’ll make it all work with Vue and Nuxt seamlessly, simplifying how to leverage this paradigm to be a workhorse for your application.",
